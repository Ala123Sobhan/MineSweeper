In the game of Minesweeper, a player searches for hidden bombs on a rectangular grid. The game board is represented by a grid of booleans 
marking bomb locations. A grid value is true if there is a bomb at that location, false otherwise. A user can click on any cell they choose. The game is lost when the user clicks on a cell containing a bomb. 
The game is won when all cells not containing bombs have been opened and the only remaining cells are those containing bombs.In this 
Minesweeper game the user is able to select the dimensions of the grid and determine how many bombs they want in there grid to be
randomly placed. If a user clicks on a cell containing zero count( which means that the adjacent cells do not have bombs),
it will reveal all the adjacent and connected zero cells and than reveal all (non-bomb) cells immediately adjacent to the revealed 
0 cells. It also prompts the user once the game is over or won to know if the user wants to continue playing or not.
